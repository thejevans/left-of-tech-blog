Running a student group at a university can be a lot of work, and building a group from scratch is even more. It's easy to fall into the trap of using corporate communication services that have free tiers, or have paid accounts offered by your university, but doing so may cause more problems later that will be harder or more expensive to fix. The goal of this article is to talk about the downsides to these services, and to offer alternatives that give your group more freedom and flexibility from the start.

I will go into specific replacements for services, and if that's all you're here for, feel free to skip this paragraph. But it is important to understand the principles that led to choosing these replacements and how to look for new ones when this article becomes out of date. Much of philosophy behind this article stems from the idea of "publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere" ([POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE)). The goal of POSSE is to keep control of your content and to give a platform-agnostic way for others to digest it. In addition to POSSE, I stay away from "ecosystems" where possible, and prioritize free and open-source software (FOSS). This combination of priorities can provide a robust set of tools that can start off with very low cost and scale nicely with your student group, while minimally subjecting your members to the data-hungry and advertising-laden services that seem, at first glance, to be the obvious choice.

## Google

Let's get the Google stuff out of the way first. Completely removing Google services for a group with no money is likely not going to happen. Your group may be able to get an email account through your university, but even then, it is probably still going to be a Google Workspace account. 

#### Gmail

Since I'm aiming toward groups with little to no funding, a Gmail account is the best option right now for most groups that need a private email account to represent the group. There are still some quirks with this option. Google designed these accounts for single users, so they will often ask for confirmation on a mobile device when a user logs in. This can be a real hassle, but there is a way around it. Google allows users to add up to 10 delegates to their accounts. These delegates are other Gmail accounts that can access and send emails from the delegated account. With this setup, your group can have up to 11 users (including someone directly accessing the group account) that can all manage your group email without any cost. [Delegate and collaborate on email](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/138350?hl=en).

Delegation is a great tool, but it's not perfect. Users cannot access delegated accounts on mobile Gmail apps, or the mobile version of the Gmail website. The workflow that I prefer is to also set up mail forwarding to the individual mail accounts of the delegated users. This way, people can get notified of and read new mail coming to the group account from any device, and then they will only need to login to Gmail on a computer to send mail from the group account.

#### Groups

Google groups is a proprietary implementation of a mailing list service tied to Google accounts. Mailing lists are used for a lot of different types of communication. The most common use case at my university is as a newsletter, where only the group leadership can post. Mailchimp is often used as an alternative for this type of mailing list, but it is geared more toward business uses than communicating with a group. Another use case, albeit less common, is to use Google groups as an asynchronus messaging platform for group communication as an alternative to more real-time tools such as Slack, Discord, and GroupMe. Mailchimp also doesn't offer this type of mailing list, which groups may want to eventually take advantage of.

[Groups.io](https://groups.io) is a tool that has feature parity with and is slightly better than Google groups in that it doesn't require a Google account to maintain, and it allows for easy scaling to a paid plan with more features to help your group as it grows. Groups.io claims on their website that they have "no ads, [and] no tracking," but their [privacy policy](https://groups.io/static/privacy) says that they reserve the right to share any data they are allowed to collect with third parties if it makes business sense for them in the future.

If you're running an activist group, [riseup.net](https://riseup.net) mailing lists are a solid alternative to Groups.io. Riseup is a collective instead of a corporation, they have much better incentives, and they have a much better [privacy policy](https://riseup.net/en/about-us/policy).

#### Drive, Docs, Slides, Etc.

For the student groups that I've worked on, Google Drive has been used for a lot of things: collaborating live on documents, a group knowledge base for future leadership, petitions and sign-up forms, password management (*shudders*), and file storage. That's a lot! Some of these things are good use cases of Google Drive, and some could be done a lot better elsewhere.

- **Live Collaboration**: Google has done a great job making it as easy as possible to jump into a document of almost any kind and collaborate in real-time with a user interface that lots of people are comfortable with. This kind of convenience is nearly impossible to beat, and there are no free tools that I know of that have feature parity and aren't run by Google or Microsoft. That being said, the vast majority of the time, when people are collaborating on a document, they are working with plain text. In these cases, [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org) is a fantastic alternative. Etherpad is FOSS that is run on thousands of sites, with many [open for public use](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/Sites-That-Run-Etherpad). For other file types, if you absolutely need real-time collaboration, then sticking with Google Docs is likely your best option. As an alternative, I would encourage you to try going without real-time collaboration.
